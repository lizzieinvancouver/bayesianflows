I am trying to use arxiv for this, following Mike' excellent suggestion. I set up an account and then:

(0) I copied bayesianflows.tex (I am putting the version as of the time I copied it in this folder) and then:
- removed all comments
- pasted in the bbl
- changed the style to agsm
- made the figures eps and put directly into same folder
- deleted a ton of packages I thought might the problem and related code (e.g., I removed line numbers and lineno and I removed gensymb and \degree) 

Then I set to uploading files. Here's what I tried:

(1) I uploaded what I thought what a nicer version of my main ms file (which is in tex, the supp is in Sweave) with the supp as PDF and the example as a zip version of the files shown here: https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/bayesianflows/tree/main/examples/synchrony/example_rel
RESULT: A bunch of dvi errors I never succeeded in understanding.

(2) I uploaded just the main text (as versionforarxiv.zip) and ...
RESULT: got the attached errors. Failing utterly.

I next emailed Mike about (2). We'll see where that goes.
