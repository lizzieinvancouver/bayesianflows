@article{nuts2014,
	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
   algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to
   correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series
   of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features
   allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more
   quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs
   sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two
   user-specified parameters: a step size is an element of and a desired
   number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm
   exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the
   algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS),
   an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L.
   NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate
   points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping
   automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps.
   Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes
   more efficiently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without
   requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a
   method for adapting the step size parameter is an element of on the fly
   based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no
   hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as
   BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient
   ``turnkey{''} samplers.},

@article{flynn2022digitaltwin,
	abstract = {Digital twins (DT) are simulation models that so closely replicate
   reality in their behaviour that experts may believe model output to be
   real. Plankton offer worthy yet tractable biological targets for digital
   twinning, due to their relatively simply physiology and significant role
   in ecology from theoretical studies through to planetary scale
   biogeochemistry. Construction of dynamic plankton DT (PDT), representing
   a supreme test of our understanding of plankton ecophysiology, would
   form the basis of education and training aids, provide platforms for
   hypothesis setting/testing, experiment design and interpretation, and
   support the construction and testing of large-scale ecosystem models and
   allied management tools. PDTs may be constructed using concepts from
   systems biology, with system dynamics, including feedback controls akin
   to biological (de)repression processes, to provide a robust approach to
   model plankton, with flexible core features enabling ready and
   meaningful configuration of phenotypic traits. Expert witness validation
   through Turing Tests would provide confidence in the end product.
   Through deployment of PDTs with appropriate input controls and output
   (visualization) tools, empiricists are more likely to engage with
   modelling, enhancing future science and increasing confidence in
   predictive operational and also in long-term climate simulations.},

	abstract = {A unique feature of Bayesian estimation is the inclusion of prior
   knowledge through prior distributions. These prior distributions can
   benefit or impair many components of the ensuing analysis. Priors are
   especially important to assess in the context of structural equation
   models (SEMs), which often carry data and modeling complexities where
   priors can be particularly influential. In this article, we illustrate a
   statistical approach to assess the impact of our prior specifications:
   the prior predictive checking procedure. We introduce a comprehensive
   prior predictive checking workflow that organizes the procedure into
   clear steps, and we relate this workflow to the SEM framework. Through
   three examples, we demonstrate how the workflow can aid researchers in
   more fully understanding different aspects of their prior specification
   within SEM. Code and additional resources are provided in the online to
   facilitate future application of the prior predictive checking procedure
   within the SEM framework.},

	abstract = {Model criticism and comparison of Bayesian hierarchical models is often
   based on posterior or leave-one-out cross-validatory predictive checks.
   Cross-validatory checks are usually preferred because posterior
   predictive checks are difficult to assess and tend to be too
   conservative. However, techniques for statistical inference in such
   models often try to avoid full (manual) leave-one-out cross-validation,
   since it is very time-consuming. In this paper we will compare two
   approaches I-or estimating Bayesian hierarchical models: Markov chain
   Monte Carlo (MCMC) and integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA).
   We review how both approaches allow for the computation of leave-one-out
   cross-validatory checks without re-running the model for each
   observation in turn. We then empirically compare the two approaches in
   an extensive case study analysing the spatial distribution of bovine
   viral diarrhoe (BVD) among cows in Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Model checking with discrete data regressions can be difficult because
   the usual methods such as residual plots have complicated reference
   distributions that depend on the parameters in the model. Posterior
   predictive checks have been proposed as a Bayesian way to average the
   results of goodness-of-fit tests in the presence of uncertainty in
   estimation of the parameters. We try this approach using a variety of
   discrepancy variables for generalized linear models fitted to a
   historical data set on behavioural learning. We then discuss the general
   applicability of our findings in the context of a recent applied example
   on which we have worked. We find that the following discrepancy
   variables work well, in the sense of being easy to interpret and
   sensitive to important model failures: structured displays of the entire
   data set, general discrepancy variables based on plots of binned or
   smoothed residuals versus predictors and specific discrepancy variables
   created on the basis of the particular concerns arising in an
   application. Plots of binned residuals are especially easy to use
   because their predictive distributions under the model are sufficiently
   simple that model checks can often be made implicitly. The following
   discrepancy variables did not work well: scatterplots of latent
   residuals defined from an underlying continuous model and
   quantile-quantile plots of these residuals.},

   mid-1900s coupled with increases in grey seal (Halichoerus grypus)
   populations is responsible for an enduring controversy between fishers
   and conservationists regarding the role seals have played in stock
   declines. We used a Bayesian state-space model to investigate stock
   trends in the presence of grey seals and associated maximum sustainable
   yield (MSY) reference points in the West of Scotland. This study
   provides new estimates of seal predation mortality on haddock

   updates the estimates for cod (Gadus morhua), which together form the
   traditional main components of the mixed demersal fishery in this area.
   Grey seal predation mortality is greatest on cod, resulting in estimates
   of total natural mortality higher than those used in the current ICES
   assessments. Seal predation mortality is low for haddock and whiting.
   Considering seal predation in stock assessments changes the scale of
   biomass and fishing mortality estimates for the three stocks. The
   estimates of F-0.1 and F-MSY are sensitive to seal predation for cod and
   whiting but not for haddock. In all cases, MSY decreases with increased

Big data generally refer to massive volumes of data not readily handled by the usual data tools and practices and present unprecedented opportunities for advancing science and informing resource management through data-intensive approaches. The era of big data need not be propelled only by "big science" - the term used to describe large-scale efforts that have had mixed success in the individual-driven culture of ecology. Collectively, ecologists already have big data to bolster the scientific effort - a large volume of distributed, high-value information - but many simply fail to contribute. We encourage ecologists to join the larger scientific community in global initiatives to address major scientific and societal problems by bringing their distributed data to the table and harnessing its collective power.

   is that priors must be specified on model parameters (e.g., intercepts,
   slopes, and sigmas), but prior knowledge often exists on the level of
   the response variable. This is particularly true for common models in
   ecology, like generalized linear mixed models that have a link function
   and potentially dozens of parameters, each of which needs a prior
   distribution. We suggest that this difficulty can be overcome by
   simulating from the prior predictive distribution and visualizing the

   choices for non-informative priors on parameters can easily be seen to
   produce biologically impossible values of response variables. Such

   Bayesian statistics is an approach to data analysis based on Bayes'

   importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a
   proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational
   inference and variable selection. Examples of successful applications of

   from ecological data, but its full potential has yet to be realized.
   Despite a generally positive trajectory in research surrounding model
   development and assessment, far too little attention has been given to
   prior specification.
   2. Default priors, a sub-class of non-informative prior distributions
   that are often chosen without critical thought or evaluation, are
   commonly used in practice. We believe the fear of being too `subjective'
   has prevented many researchers from usinganyprior information in their
   analyses despite the fact that defending prior choice (informative or
   not) promotes good statistical practice.
   3. In this commentary, we provide an overview of how BDA is currently
   being used in a random sample of articles, discuss implications for
   inference if current bad practices continue, and highlight sub-fields
   where knowledge about the system has improved inference and promoted
   good statistical practices through the careful and justified use of
   informative priors.

   prior information, the defining characteristic of Bayesian philosophy,
   are nearly nonexistent in the ecological literature. Here, I hope to
   encourage the use of weakly informative priors in ecology and evolution
   by providing a `consumer's guide' to weakly informative priors. The
   first section outlines three reasons why ecologists should abandon
   noninformative priors: 1) common flat priors are not always
   noninformative, 2) noninformative priors provide the same result as
   simpler frequentist methods, and 3) noninformative priors suffer from
   the same high type I and type M error rates as frequentist methods. The
   second section provides a guide for implementing informative priors,
   wherein I detail convenient `reference' prior distributions for common
   statistical models (i.e. regression, ANOVA, hierarchical models). I then
   use simulations to visually demonstrate how informative priors influence
   posterior parameter estimates. With the guidelines provided here, I hope
   to encourage the use of weakly informative priors for Bayesian analyses
   in ecology. Ecologists can and should debate the appropriate form of
   prior information, but should consider weakly informative priors as the
   new `default' prior for any Bayesian model.},

@article{conn2018,
	abstract = {Checking that models adequately represent data is an essential component
   of applied statistical inference. Ecologists increasingly use
   hierarchical Bayesian statistical models in their research. The appeal
   of this modeling paradigm is undeniable, as researchers can build and
   fit models that embody complex ecological processes while simultaneously
   accounting for observation error. However, ecologists tend to be less
   focused on checking model assumptions and assessing potential lack of
   fit when applying Bayesian methods than when applying more traditional
   modes of inference such as maximum likelihood. There are also multiple
   ways of assessing the fit of Bayesian models, each of which has
   strengths and weaknesses. For instance, Bayesian P values are relatively
   easy to compute, but are well known to be conservative, producing P
   values biased toward 0.5. Alternatively, lesser known approaches to
   model checking, such as prior predictive checks, cross-validation
   probability integral transforms, and pivot discrepancy measures may
   produce more accurate characterizations of goodness-of-fit but are not
   as well known to ecologists. In addition, a suite of visual and targeted
   diagnostics can be used to examine violations of different model
   assumptions and lack of fit at different levels of the modeling
   hierarchy, and to check for residual temporal or spatial
   autocorrelation. In this review, we synthesize existing literature to
   guide ecologists through the many available options for Bayesian model
   checking. We illustrate methods and procedures with several ecological
   case studies including (1) analysis of simulated spatiotemporal count
   data, (2) N-mixture models for estimating abundance of sea otters from
   an aircraft, and (3) hidden Markov modeling to describe attendance
   patterns of California sea lion mothers on a rookery. We find that
   commonly used procedures based on posterior predictive P values detect
   extreme model inadequacy, but often do not detect more subtle cases of
   lack of fit. Tests based on cross-validation and pivot discrepancy
   measures (including the ``sampled predictive P value{''}) appear to be
   better suited to model checking and to have better overall statistical
   performance. We conclude that model checking is necessary to ensure that
   scientific inference is well founded. As an essential component of
   scientific discovery, it should accompany most Bayesian analyses
   presented in the literature.},
