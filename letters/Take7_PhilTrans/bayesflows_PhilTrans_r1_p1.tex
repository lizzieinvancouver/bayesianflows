\opening{Dear Dr. Gelman:}

Please consider our revised manuscript, ``A four-step simulation-based workflow for ecological analysis and science'' as an Opinion for the special issue in \emph{Philosophical Transactions A}.

Comments from two reviewers and the editor have led to a much improved manuscript. We have added a new example, overhauled the introduction, and made additional smaller changes throughout---including edits to the abstract and title. We detail these edits in our point-by-point response letter. 

All authors have contributed to and approved of this re-submission, and the manuscript is not currently submitted to or in review with another publication. We hope that you will find it suitable for publication in \emph{Philosophical Transactions A}. 

Sincerely,\\

Associate Professor of Forest \& Conservation Sciences\\
