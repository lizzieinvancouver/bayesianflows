Subject: Proposal for Method in Ecology Letters

Dear Dr. Drake:

We would like to propose a Method piece for Ecology Letters outlining a four-step simulation based workflow for statistical analyses in ecology, and show how it can enhance data collection, forecasting, and statistical training. More details can be found in the attached letter, which includes draft figures.

We hope you will consider it as potential submission for Ecology Letters and look forward to your response to our proposal.

Thank you,
Lizzie
