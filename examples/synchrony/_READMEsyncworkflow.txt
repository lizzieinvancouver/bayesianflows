IMPORTANT update 

In brief, I am NO LONGER updating the files here and will update to new repo for this:
lizzieinvancouver/bayesianflowsexample

See below 17 October 2024

How to compile Rmd (from https://rowannicholls.github.io/sublime_text/r_markdown.html)
Render it with the Build System!
    Open an R Markdown file with the .Rmd extension
    From the menu bar, go to Tools > Build With…
    From then on you can just build with Ctrl+B/Cmd+B as the default build system will have been set when you used “Build With…”

I pulled some random stuff (says Lizzie), need to ORGANIZE! And clean up a ton ... or just find better examples. 

UPDATE 12 February 2024:
synchrony4steps.R runs well and has all the basic steps now, but we should probably simplify:
	- Posterior predictive checks (Step 4) and beyond especially.
	- Maybe make a new file with the minimal to take over to markdown. 

Manuscript figure: rawvsonepredictivecheck.pdf is built in synchrony4stepsfull.R.

Update 3 July 2024:

example_rel is a folder I made with the .Rmd set up to work with relative paths (all the files you need; so DUPLICATING everything in examples/synchrony). It runs on my computer.

Update 8 October 2024:

Sylvain Schmitt made me a RENV version on his github during review. 
I cloned it and it's here: git/projects/misc/miscmisc/renvforbayesianflowsexample

IMPORTANT update on 17 October 2024

I move the relative example to lizzieinvancouver/bayesianflowsexample
Because ESA asked and I need to anyway. I will update the files there. 
To keep things simple I will delete a ton of the related code here. 
Wish me luck!
Deletions in f40df01013d594dd9a895ddc85718fdd2e8d6edb mostly.
