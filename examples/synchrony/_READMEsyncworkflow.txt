Most of these files taken from git/teaching/hotstats/examples

I pulled some random stuff (says Lizzie), need to ORGANIZE! And clean up a ton ... or just find better examples. 

UPDATE 12 February 2024:
synchrony4steps.R runs well and has all the basic steps now, but we should probably simplify:
	- Posterior predictive checks (Step 4) and beyond especially.
	- Maybe make a new file with the minimal to take over to markdown.
