How to compile Rmd (from https://rowannicholls.github.io/sublime_text/r_markdown.html)
Render it with the Build System!
    Open an R Markdown file with the .Rmd extension
    From the menu bar, go to Tools > Build With…
    From then on you can just build with Ctrl+B/Cmd+B as the default build system will have been set when you used “Build With…”

I pulled some random stuff (says Lizzie), need to ORGANIZE! And clean up a ton ... or just find better examples. 

UPDATE 12 February 2024:
synchrony4steps.R runs well and has all the basic steps now, but we should probably simplify:
	- Posterior predictive checks (Step 4) and beyond especially.
	- Maybe make a new file with the minimal to take over to markdown. 

Manuscript figure: rawvsonepredictivecheck.pdf is built in synchrony4stepsfull.R.

Update 3 July 2024:

example_rel is a folder I made with the .Rmd set up to work with relative paths (all the files you need; so DUPLICATING everything in examples/synchrony). It runs on my computer.
